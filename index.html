            <h2> Cuphead?</h2> <br>
            <div>
                Cuphead is a 2D side-scrolling run-and-gun video game developed and published by Studio MDHR. The game was first released in 2017 for Xbox One, Windows, and macOS, and has since been released on other platforms such as Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4.
                The game's development began in 2010, and it took the small team of brothers Chad and Jared Moldenhauer several years to bring their vision to life. </div>
            </div>

            <div class="contentS">
                Cuphead features one or two players taking control of animated characters Cuphead and his brother Mugman to fight through several levels that culminate in boss fights as to repay their debt to The Devil. The game was praised for its art style and noted for its challenging difficulty. It was both a critical and commercial success, winning several awards and selling over four million copies by July 2019.

        <div class="contentT">
            <h3>The all-cartoon Magical Wondergame!</h3>
                Cuphead is a classic run and gun action game heavily focused on boss battles. Inspired by cartoons of the 1930s, the visuals and audio are painstakingly created with the same techniques of the era, i.e. traditional hand drawn cel animation, watercolor backgrounds, and original jazz recordings.
                Play as Cuphead or Mugman (in single player or local co-op) as you traverse strange worlds, acquire new weapons, learn powerful super moves, and discover hidden secrets while you try to pay your debt back to the devil!

            <h2> Plot</h2> <br>
            <div>
              On Inkwell Isle, Cuphead and his brother Mugman are two fun-loving kids who live under the watchful eye of Elder Kettle. Against the elder's warnings, the brothers wander into the Devil's Casino and play craps. When the brothers go on a winning streak, the casino's manager King Dice calls upon the Devil, who raises the stakes. If Cuphead and Mugman can win another time, they will own the entire casino; if not, the Devil will have their souls. Cuphead rolls snake eyes and he and Mugman must give up their souls. The brothers beg for mercy, so the Devil makes a deal with them: collect the contracts of other inhabitants of Inkwell Isle who have lost their souls by midnight the next day.
              Cuphead and Mugman travel around Inkwell Isle collecting soul contracts from residents who have lost their souls to King Dice and the Devil. Eventually, Elder Kettle tells the brothers that when facing the Devil again, they must "do the right thing". Once they make it back to the Casino, King Dice reveals that he too lost a bet, presumably about whether or not Cuphead and Mugman would be able to retrieve the contracts. He fights the two only to lose. The Devil then asks the brothers about the contracts and in return they will "join his team".

            </div>
            
            </div>

            <div class="contentS2">
                The brothers eventually collect all the soul contracts and return to the Devil's Casino. King Dice stops them, saying that their success has caused him to lose a bet, and has the duo battle his minions as well as himself. After defeating King Dice, the brothers confront the Devil, who tries to tempt them by inviting them to join his team if they give him the soul contracts.

            <h3>The cup brothers</h3>
               The brothers travel around the Inkwell Isles, fighting the residents who have lost their souls to the Devil in order to obtain their contracts. On entering the second island, the Elder Kettle informs them about "doing the right thing" when they come up against the Devil again. Once they have the contracts, they return to the Devil's Casino, but its manager King Dice blocks their way. He has lost a bet with the Devil, presumably over whether Cuphead and Mugman would be able to complete their task, and forces them to fight his own henchmen before confronting them directly.
